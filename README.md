MISP widget collection - for widgets that might be more situational but still handy

Simply clone the repository into your MISP custom dashboard directory such as this:

`cd /var/www/MISP/app/Lib/Dashboard/Custom`

`git clone https://github.com/MISP/widget-collection.git`

and the widgets will be available in your MISP instance.
